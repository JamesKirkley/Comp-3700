This project aims to build a working prototype, client-server for the "Store Management System".

1. It is a single user, client-server software application. That means, there is only one user (the "store manager" to interact with the system). However, the user interacts with the system via a client component, while a server component (might be running in a different machine) provides the data services.

The user has the following 6 user stories (corresponding to 6 functions that the system will provide to the user):

• As a store manager, I want to add information of a new product

• As a store manager, I want to add information of a new customer

• As a store manager, I want to add information of a new order

• As a store manager, I want to change information of an existing product

• As a store manager, I want to change information of an existing customer

• As a store manager, I want to change information of an existing order

2. This system is designed with 3 architectural patterns:

a. Three-tier layers: Data Access; Business Logic, and User Interface. The Data Access layer is separated into client side and server side.

b. Model-View-Controller

c. Client-Server

3. This system is designed with the following object-oriented design patterns: Singleton; Adapter;

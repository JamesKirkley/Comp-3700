This project aims to build a working prototype for the "Store Management System".

1. It is a single user, local software application. That means, there is only one user (the "store manager" to interact with the system).

The user has the following 6 user stories (corresponding to 6 functions that the system will provide to the user):

• As a store manager, I want to add information of a new product

• As a store manager, I want to add information of a new customer

• As a store manager, I want to add information of a new order

• As a store manager, I want to change information of an existing product

• As a store manager, I want to change information of an existing customer

• As a store manager, I want to change information of an existing order

2. This system is designed with two architectural patterns:

a. Three-tier layers: Data Access; Business Logic, and User Interface.

b. Model-View-Controller

3. This system is designed with the following object-oriented design patterns: Singleton; Adapter;
